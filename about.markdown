Hi, my name is Yingjie, but many call me Tim (ask me why). 

I am currently a senior at Tufts with a double major in Computer Science and Biology. I am also a member of the [Lin's Group](https://ase.tufts.edu/chemistry/lin/index.html) at Tufts. 

I enjoy coding, cooking, and any outdoor activities. 

I am still exploring the different possibilities in life, and I guess that is the interesting part of it:v::crossed_fingers:. 

I am originally from Shanghai:night_with_stars:, where I stayed until college. 

You can find my resume [here](/assets/Yingjie_Ling_Fall_2021.pdf).
